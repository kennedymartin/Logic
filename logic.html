  <h2>American Rapper</h2>
  <p>Logic - the 27-year-old rapper born Sir Robert Bryson Hall II  - burst onto the music scene through a series
     of mixtapes that led to a significant, rabid underground fan base.</p>
  <p>With his debut album Under Pressure in 2014, the Gaithersburg, Maryland bred MC, broke free from the pack
     and established himself as one of the brightest young stars in music.</p>
